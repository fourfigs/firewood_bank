- **Warm Earth** (#8b6f47) - Separators, borders

- ✅ Generous padding (8-12px)
- ✅ High contrast text

---

## 📊 **FILES MODIFIED THIS SESSION**

### Core System:

- ✅ `src/db/database.cpp` - Added Lead default user

### UI Redesigned:
- ✅ `src/ui/LoginDialog.cpp` - Beautiful fiery styling
- ✅ `src/ui/MainWindow.cpp` - Updated permissions
- ✅ `src/ui/MyProfileDialog.h/cpp` - Admin direct edit
- ✅ `src/ui/DashboardWidget.h/cpp` - **COMPLETE REDESIGN**

---

## 🚀 **HOW TO USE**

### First Time Setup:
```powershell
# Delete old database to get new Lead user
Remove-Item "$env:APPDATA\Roaming\FirewoodBank\firewood.db"

# Run the app
.\build\bin\Release\firewood_bank.exe
```

### Test All Features:
1. **Login as `admin`** - See direct profile editing
2. **Login as `lead`** - See Employee List button, can edit inventory
3. **Login as `user`** - See limited permissions (view only)
4. **Check Dashboard** - See the beautiful 3-panel layout
5. **Test Logout** - Click 🚪 button, returns to login

---

## 🎯 **REMAINING (Optional Future Enhancements)**

### Admin Inventory Management (Not Critical):
- Set minimum stock levels per item
- Alerts when inventory hits minimum
- Auto-order notifications at thresholds

**This would require:**
- New database table: `inventory_minimum_levels`
- Admin UI to configure thresholds
- Alert system integration

---

## 💡 **TECHNICAL HIGHLIGHTS**

### Permission System:
```cpp
// Leads can edit inventory (key requirement met!)
if (Authorization::isAdmin(m_role) || Authorization::isLead(m_role)) {
    // Can edit inventory
}

// Employees can only view
if (Authorization::hasPermission(m_role, Permission::ViewInventory)) {
    // View only, no edit buttons
}
```

### Beautiful 2-Week Calendar:
```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < 14; i++) {
    QDate date = startDate.addDays(i);
    // Day name (Monday, Tuesday, etc.)
    // Full date (October 16, 2025)
    // Separator line
}
```

### Visual Inventory with Icons:
```cpp
🪵 WOOD - Wood icon, split vs rounds
⛽ GAS  - Gas icon, regular vs mixed
🪚 SAWS - Saw icon, operational count
```
