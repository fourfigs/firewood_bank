# üîß Sample Data Loading - Troubleshooting Guide

## Problem: Sample Data Not Appearing After Load

If you click "Load Sample Data" and don't see the data populate after refreshing, follow this guide.

---

## ‚úÖ **What I Just Fixed:**

### 1. **Enhanced Debugging Output**
The system now prints detailed information to the console:
- Current working directory
- Application directory
- Each path it checks for SAMPLE_DATA.sql
- Whether the file exists at each location
- Number of SQL statements executed
- Success/failure count

### 2. **Added Missing Includes**
Added `QFileInfo` and `QCoreApplication` includes to `database.cpp` to fix path resolution.

### 3. **Better Error Messages**
The error dialog now shows:
- Expected file location
- Troubleshooting steps
- Link to check console output

## üîç **How to Diagnose the Issue:**

###Step 1: Check Console Output**

When you click "Load Sample Data", the console will show:

```
=== SAMPLE DATA LOAD START ===
Current directory: C:/Users/humbo/firewood_bank/build/bin/Release
Application path: C:/Users/humbo/firewood_bank/build/bin/Release
Loading sample data...
Current working directory: C:/Users/humbo/firewood_bank/build/bin/Release
Application directory: C:/Users/humbo/firewood_bank/build/bin/Release
Checking: C:/Users/humbo/firewood_bank/docs/SAMPLE_DATA.sql
‚úÖ Found sample data file at: C:/Users/humbo/firewood_bank/docs/SAMPLE_DATA.sql
Loading SQL script from: C:/Users/humbo/firewood_bank/docs/SAMPLE_DATA.sql

```

## ‚ùå **Common Problems & Solutions:**

### Problem 1: "Could not find SAMPLE_DATA.sql"

**Console shows:**
```
ERROR: Could not find SAMPLE_DATA.sql in any expected location
Tried locations:
  - C:/Users/humbo/firewood_bank/docs/SAMPLE_DATA.sql [NOT FOUND]
  - ...
```

**Solution:**
1. Verify the file exists:
   ```powershell
   ls C:\Users\humbo\firewood_bank\docs\SAMPLE_DATA.sql
   ```

2. If missing, the file should be in your repository at `docs/SAMPLE_DATA.sql`

3. Try running from the project root:
   ```powershell
   cd C:\Users\humbo\firewood_bank
   .\build\bin\Release\firewood_bank.exe
   ```

---

### Problem 2: "File found but no data appears"

**Console shows:**
```
‚úÖ Found sample data file
SQL Script Results:
  ‚úÖ Success: 0
  ‚ö†Ô∏è Failed/Skipped: 432
```

**Possible Causes:**
- File is corrupted or has syntax errors
- Database constraints preventing insertion
- Data already exists (UNIQUE constraints)

**Solution:**
1. Check if data already exists:
   - Look at the Clients tab - are there already clients?
   - If yes, the data might have loaded before!

2. Try the "Clear ALL Data" function first (Admin only):
   - Admin Tools ‚Üí Clear ALL Data
   - Then reload sample data

3. Check for specific error messages in console:
   ```
   WARNING: Failed to execute statement: INSERT INTO households...
     Error: UNIQUE constraint failed: households.id
   ```
   This means the data is already there!

---

### Problem 3: "Success message but tables still empty"

**Console shows:**
```
‚úÖ Success: 127
Households now has 0 rows
```

**Solution:**
1. Press **F5** to refresh
2. Switch between tabs to trigger refresh
3. Restart the application
4. Check if you're logged in as the right user (Admin can see all tabs)

---

##üéØ **Quick Test:**

### **Method 1: From Project Root**
```powershell
cd C:\Users\humbo\firewood_bank
.\build\bin\Release\firewood_bank.exe
```

### **Method 2: Check File Exists**
```powershell
Test-Path "C:\Users\humbo\firewood_bank\docs\SAMPLE_DATA.sql"
```
Should return `True`

### **Method 3: Check File Size**
```powershell
(Get-Item "C:\Users\humbo\firewood_bank\docs\SAMPLE_DATA.sql").Length
```
Should show around **44-46 KB**

4. **Inventory Tab** - Should have 25+ items

## üõ†Ô∏è **Advanced Troubleshooting:**

### Check Database Directly:

```powershell
# Install SQLite tools if you haven't
# Then open the database:
sqlite3 "C:\Users\humbo\AppData\Roaming\FirewoodBank\firewood.db"

# Check if data exists:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM households;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM inventory_items;

# Exit:
.quit
```

## üìû **Still Having Issues?**

1. **Compile a fresh build:**
   ```powershell
   cmake --build build --config Release
   ```

2. **Run with console visible:**
   - Open PowerShell
   - Navigate to: `cd C:\Users\humbo\firewood_bank`
   - Run: `.\build\bin\Release\firewood_bank.exe`
   - Watch the console output when you click "Load Sample Data"

3. **Copy the console output** and we can diagnose from there!

## ‚úÖ **Expected Behavior:**

```
User clicks: Admin Tools ‚Üí Load Sample Data
  ‚Üì
Warning dialog: "This will populate your database..."
