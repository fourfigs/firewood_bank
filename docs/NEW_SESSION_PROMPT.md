- Check errors (no crashes!)
- Follow existing patterns

### 4. **Test Thoroughly**
After each change:
```powershell
cmake --build build --config Release
.\build\bin\Release\firewood_bank.exe
```
- Login as admin / lead / employee / volunteer
- Test your feature
- Check console for errors
- Press F5 to refresh views

### 5. **Document What You Do**
- Update session summary
- Add comments to code
- Create guides if needed
- Update TODO.md if appropriate
