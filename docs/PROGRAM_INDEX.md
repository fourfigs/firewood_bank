## 🔐 Security Analysis

### Current Security Measures ✅

#### **What's Secure:**
1. **SQL Injection Protection** ✅
   - All queries use prepared statements
   - `bindValue()` used throughout
   - No string concatenation in SQL

2. **Role-Based Access Control** ✅
   - 4 distinct roles with granular permissions
   - UI elements hidden/disabled based on role
   - Authorization checks before sensitive operations

3. **Password Storage** ⚠️ **PARTIAL**
   - SHA-256 hashing implemented
   - ❌ **NO SALT** - vulnerable to rainbow tables
   - ❌ **NO KEY STRETCHING** - vulnerable to brute force

### Critical Security Vulnerabilities ⚠️

#### **HIGH PRIORITY RISKS:**

1. **Plain Text Database** 🚨
   - SQLite file is **completely unencrypted**
   - Anyone with file access can read ALL data
   - **Risk:** Sensitive client info (addresses, phone numbers, gate codes)
   - **Solution:** Implement SQLCipher encryption

2. **Weak Password Hashing** 🚨
   - SHA-256 without salt is inadequate
   - Vulnerable to rainbow table attacks
   - No protection against brute force
   - **Solution:** Upgrade to Argon2id with per-user salt

3. **No Session Management** ⚠️
   - No automatic logout/timeout
   - No failed login tracking
   - No account lockout mechanism
   - **Solution:** Implement 30-minute session timeout

4. **No Audit Logging** ⚠️
   - No record of who did what
   - No tracking of data exports
   - No failed access attempt logging
   - **Solution:** Create comprehensive audit_log table

5. **Sensitive Data Exposure** ⚠️
   - Gate codes stored in plain text
   - Phone numbers unencrypted
   - Email addresses unencrypted
   - **Solution:** Field-level encryption for sensitive data

### Security Recommendations Priority

**CRITICAL (Do Immediately):**
1. Database encryption (SQLCipher)
2. Upgrade password hashing (Argon2id + salt)
3. Automated backups with encryption
4. Audit logging system

**HIGH (Do Soon):**
5. Session timeout (30 minutes)
6. Failed login tracking
7. Sensitive field encryption
8. Code signing for releases

**MEDIUM (Future):**
9. String obfuscation in source
10. Executable packing (UPX)
11. Anti-debugging measures

## 🔄 Application Flow

### Startup Sequence
```
1. main() → QApplication initialization
2. openDefaultConnection() → Database setup
3. runMigrations() → Schema updates (if needed)
4. LoginDialog shown → User authentication
5. validateCredentials() → SHA-256 hash comparison
6. MainWindow created → Role-based UI setup
7. setupDatabaseModels() → Load data tables
8. applyRoleBasedPermissions() → Hide/show features
```

### Login Flow
```cpp
// LoginDialog::validateCredentials()
1. Hash entered password with SHA-256
2. Query: SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password_hash = ?
3. If match found:
   - Store username, role, full_name
   - Update last_login timestamp
   - Return true
4. If no match:
   - Show error message
   - Clear password field
   - Return false
```

### Work Order Completion Flow (Critical Business Logic)
```cpp
// WorkOrderDialog::accept()
1. User sets status to "Completed"
2. System validates:
   - Delivery date is set
   - Driver is assigned
   - End mileage > start mileage
3. Auto-fill delivered_cords = 0.33 (1/3 cord default)
4. On save:
   a. Update orders table
   b. Auto-deduct from inventory (Split wood)
   c. Create delivery_log entry with mileage
   d. Update household order_count and last_order_date
5. Dashboard statistics refresh automatically
```

### Inventory Auto-Update Logic
```cpp
// When order status = "Completed"
1. Query: SELECT id FROM inventory_items WHERE item_name LIKE '%Split%'
2. Calculate: new_quantity = current_quantity - delivered_cords
3. Update: SET quantity = new_quantity WHERE id = split_wood_id
4. Log: "✅ Auto-updated inventory: -0.33 cords"
```

---

## 🚨 Critical Security Considerations

### For Production Deployment

#### **MUST DO Before Going Live:**

1. **Change Default Passwords** 🔴
   ```sql
   -- Current default passwords are PUBLICLY DOCUMENTED
   -- admin/admin, lead/lead, user/user, volunteer/volunteer
   -- These MUST be changed immediately!
   ```

2. **Implement Database Encryption** 🔴
   ```cpp
   // Current: Plain text SQLite file
   // Anyone with file access = full data access
   // Implement SQLCipher ASAP
   ```

3. **Upgrade Password Hashing** 🔴
   ```cpp
   // Current: SHA-256 (no salt)
   // Vulnerable to rainbow tables
   // Upgrade to: Argon2id with per-user salt
   ```

4. **Set Up Automated Backups** 🔴
   ```
   // No backup system exists
   // Data loss risk is HIGH
   // Implement daily encrypted backups
   ```

5. **Restrict File Permissions** 🔴
   ```
   // Database file location: %APPDATA%/Firewood Bank/
   // Ensure only application user can read/write
   ```

### Idiot-Proofing Measures Already Implemented ✅

1. **Multiple Confirmations for Destructive Actions**
   - Delete client: "Are you sure?"
   - Clear all data: Type "DELETE ALL DATA" to confirm
   - Export warnings: "This exports sensitive data"

2. **Auto-Population to Prevent Errors**
   - Client info auto-fills in work orders
   - Default delivery amount (0.33 cords)
   - Current date/time pre-filled

3. **Validation Checks**
   - Required fields enforced
   - End mileage must be > start mileage
   - Delivered cords cannot exceed requested
   - Phone number format validation

4. **Visual Feedback**
   - Golden glow on required fields
   - Color-coded status indicators
   - Clear error messages
   - Success confirmations

5. **Role-Based UI Hiding**
   - Users can't see what they can't access
   - Buttons disabled/hidden based on permissions
   - Prevents confusion and mistakes

### Additional Idiot-Proofing Needed

1. **Session Timeout** - Prevent unauthorized access if user walks away
2. **Failed Login Lockout** - Prevent brute force attacks
3. **Audit Logging** - Track who did what for accountability
4. **Backup Reminders** - Prompt admin to backup regularly
5. **Data Validation** - More robust input sanitization

1. Read `README.md` - User-facing documentation
2. Read `docs/FINAL_FEATURE_LIST.md` - Complete feature overview
3. Examine `src/db/database.cpp` - Understand schema evolution
4. Study `src/core/Authorization.cpp` - Permission system
5. Review `src/ui/MainWindow.cpp` - Application structure

**Key Concepts:**
- **Migrations:** Database schema changes are versioned and incremental
- **Prepared Statements:** All SQL uses parameterized queries (security)
- **Role-Based UI:** Interface adapts based on user role
- **Auto-Updates:** Inventory automatically adjusts when orders complete
- **Audit Trail:** Delivery log tracks all mileage and deliveries

**Common Tasks:**
- **Add new field to table:** Create new migration in `database.cpp`
- **Add new permission:** Update `Authorization.cpp` enum and logic
- **Add new dialog:** Follow pattern in existing dialogs (e.g., `ClientDialog`)
- **Modify UI colors:** Update `StyleSheet.h` constants

### Testing Recommendations

**Manual Testing:**
1. Test all 4 user roles separately
2. Try to break permission system
3. Test with large datasets (100+ clients)
4. Test all export functions
5. Test delivery workflow end-to-end
