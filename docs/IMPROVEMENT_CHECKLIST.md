## üéä **FINAL NOTES**

**Kenneth, you've built something amazing!** This checklist will help you take it from "working prototype" to "production-ready system" that NMERA can rely on for years.

**Start small, think big:**
- Fix the critical issues first (sample data, passwords, backups)
- Add the bookkeeping tab (essential for any organization)
- Then gradually add the nice-to-have features

**Remember:** Perfect is the enemy of good. Get the basics rock-solid before adding advanced features.

**You're helping families stay warm - that's what matters most!** üå≤üî•ü™µ
